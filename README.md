## About Repository
<!--Wirte one paragraph of project description -->  
The purpose of this project is to effectively promote 'SeoulTech' using 'quiz' content.

## Overview
<!-- Write Overview about this project -->
&nbsp; **'Seoul National University of Science and Technology'** is the only national university in Seoul. This project was carried out to solve the problem of low recognition compared to the school's development potential and competency.

&nbsp; **Seoultech Explore** is a web game that explores a school based on a mysterious incident that takes place at Seoul National University of Science and Technology. Each school building has a nonsense quiz, and it is a 'web labyrinth' game in which the next story can only be progressed after solving the quiz.
